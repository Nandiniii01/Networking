# Networking
Networking is the process of making connections and building relationships. These connections can provide you with advice and contacts, which can help you make informed career decisions. Networking can even help you Ô¨Ånd unadvertised jobs/internships. Networking can take place in a group or one-on-one setting.
## Bridge
A Linux bridge behaves like a network switch. It forwards packets between interfaces that are connected to it. It's usually used for forwarding packets on routers, on gateways, or between VMs and network namespaces on a host. It also supports STP, VLAN filter, and multicast snooping.
## VLAN
A VLAN, aka virtual LAN, separates broadcast domains by adding tags to network packets. VLANs allow network administrators to group hosts under the same switch or between different switches.
## VXLAN
VXLAN (Virtual eXtensible Local Area Network) is a tunneling protocol designed to solve the problem of limited VLAN IDs (4,096) in IEEE 802.1q. It is described by IETF RFC 7348.

With a 24-bit segment ID, aka VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI), VXLAN allows up to 2^24 (16,777,216) virtual LANs, which is 4,096 times the VLAN capacity.
## MACVLAN
With VLAN, you can create multiple interfaces on top of a single one and filter packages based on a VLAN tag. With MACVLAN, you can create multiple interfaces with different Layer 2 (that is, Ethernet MAC) addresses on top of a single one.

Before MACVLAN, if you wanted to connect to physical network from a VM or namespace, you would have needed to create TAP/VETH devices and attach one side to a bridge and attach a physical interface to the bridge on the host at the same time.

## VETH
The VETH (virtual Ethernet) device is a local Ethernet tunnel. Devices are created in pairs, as shown in the diagram below.
Packets transmitted on one device in the pair are immediately received on the other device. When either device is down, the link state of the pair is down.

##  VCAN
Similar to the network loopback devices, the VCAN (virtual CAN) driver offers a virtual local CAN (Controller Area Network) interface, so users can send/receive CAN messages via a VCAN interface. CAN is mostly used in the automotive field nowadays.
##  VXCAN
Similar to the VETH driver, a VXCAN (Virtual CAN tunnel) implements a local CAN traffic tunnel between two VCAN network devices. When you create a VXCAN instance, two VXCAN devices are created as a pair. When one end receives the packet, the packet appears on the device's pair and vice versa. VXCAN can be used for cross-namespace communication.
